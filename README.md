Generate a stochastic midi sequence to drive a midi drone. Patterns are from [Learn to Play Indian Sitar Ragas on a Piano](https://www.amazon.com/Play-Indian-Sitar-R%C4%81gas-Piano/dp/B08DBVQZK8/ref=sr_1_1?crid=22RI8U7EYGBB&keywords=John+Pitts+How+to+Play+Indian&qid=1673829772&sprefix=john+pitts+how+to+play+indian%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-1) from John Pitts.

For a full explanation of patterns try `gendrone -s`.
